Project Report: Predicting Clinical Trial Site Success Rates
Introduction
This project aims to predict the success rate of clinical trial sites using various regression models. 
The dataset clinical_trial_sites.csv contains features related to clinical trial sites and their respective success rates. 
By applying advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a robust model to accurately predict these success rates.

Dataset Description
The dataset clinical_trial_sites.csv includes the following columns:

site_id: Unique identifier for each clinical trial site (excluded from features).
trial_success_rate: The target variable representing the success rate of clinical trials at the site.
Various numeric and categorical features representing site characteristics.
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve:

Separating Features and Target: The site_id and trial_success_rate columns are excluded from features (X), with trial_success_rate being the target (y).
Splitting Data: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Identifying Feature Types:
Numeric Features: Columns with integer or float data types.
Categorical Features: Columns with object data types.
Defining Transformers:
Numeric Transformer: Imputation with median values and scaling.
Categorical Transformer: Imputation with the most frequent value and one-hot encoding.
Combining Transformers: Using ColumnTransformer to apply appropriate transformations to numeric and categorical features.
Model Selection and Tuning
Six regression models were considered for bagging and boosting techniques:

RandomForestRegressor
GradientBoostingRegressor
AdaBoostRegressor
BaggingRegressor (using LinearRegression as the base estimator)
XGBRegressor
LGBMRegressor
Each model was incorporated into a pipeline with the preprocessor and tuned using RandomizedSearchCV with predefined parameter grids.

Training and Evaluation
Training: Each model was trained on the training set using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
Evaluation: The models were evaluated on the testing set using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the performance metric.
Results
The RMSE for each model is as follows:

AdaBoost RMSE: <RMSE_Value>
Bagging RMSE: <RMSE_Value>
XGBoost RMSE: <RMSE_Value>
LightGBM RMSE: <RMSE_Value>
Best Model
The model with the lowest RMSE on the test set was identified as the best model. The best model was saved using joblib for future use.

Conclusion
This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to predict clinical trial site success rates. 
The model development process involved data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
